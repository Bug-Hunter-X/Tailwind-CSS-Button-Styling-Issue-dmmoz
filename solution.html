To fix this, ensure that:

1. **Tailwind CSS is correctly installed and configured:** Check your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that the correct paths are specified.
2. **Tailwind directives are included in your CSS:**  Make sure you've added `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;` in your main CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`).
3. **CSS specificity:** Other CSS rules might be overriding your Tailwind classes. Try adding `!important` to your Tailwind classes (as a last resort), or inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to identify conflicting styles.
4. **Build process:**  If you're using a bundler like Webpack or Vite, ensure that your build process correctly handles Tailwind CSS.

Here's an example of correctly configured HTML and CSS:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind Button</title>
  <link href="../dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Click Me
  </button>
</body>
</html>
```
```css
/* styles.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
