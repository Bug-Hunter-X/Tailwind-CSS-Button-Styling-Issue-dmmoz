The following code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a button, but the button does not display correctly. 
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
This might happen if there is a conflict with other CSS or if Tailwind CSS is not correctly configured or imported.
